# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for various competitive programming problems! This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey through the exciting world of algorithms and data structures.

## About

Here you'll find my code submissions and approaches to problems from platforms like:

* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/atsuchak)
* [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/atsuchak)
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/atsuchak/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/atsuchak)
* ... and more!

My goal in maintaining this repository is to:

* **Document my learning process:** By storing these solutions, I can revisit my past approaches and learn from them.
* **Serve as a reference:** This collection can be a helpful resource for reviewing specific algorithms or problem-solving techniques.
* **Showcase my skills:** This repository provides a tangible demonstration of my competitive programming abilities.

## Structure

* `Competitive Programming/` is the root directory for all competitive programming solutions.
* `PlatformName` indicates the online judge or contest platform (e.g., Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode).
* `ContestName` is the name or identifier of a specific contest (e.g., Codeforces Round #XXX, ABCXXX).
* `PracticeSet` is the name or identifier of a practice set or problem list 
* `solution.ext` contains my solution code in the respective programming language.

## How to Navigate

You can browse through the different platforms and problem sets to find the solutions you're interested in. Each problem directory ideally contains the source code and potentially a brief comment or explanation within the code itself.

## Contributions and Feedback

As this is primarily a personal repository, direct contributions are not expected. However, if you happen to stumble upon any insights, alternative solutions, or potential improvements, I'd be very interested to hear them! Feel free to reach out or open an issue to share your thoughts.
